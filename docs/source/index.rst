Globus Pilot
============


Introduction
------------

Globus pilot is an SDK and command line utility for coupling records in Globus Search
with data on a Globus Endpoint. One single pilot command will both do the data upload
and the publication, without the need to talk to both services individually to ensure
search records and data are in sync.
